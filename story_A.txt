The engine coughed once before dawn.
Steam rose, thin and patient, from the ground.
The conductor tapped his watch; time was leaking.
Wheels began to turn somewhere beyond the fog.
He wondered if the world still ran on coal or hope.
The whistle cut the morning like a signature.
Then the train, almost kindly, gathered speed.
